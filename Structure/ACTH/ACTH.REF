ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) is also
know as corticotropin.

MW = 4540
39 amino acids

[ACTH] = 30 pG/mL or 3 nG/dL or 11 pMol/L

nG/dL * 2.20 = pMol/L

Volume of distribution = 15000 (ECFV, assumed).

Mass = 750 nG

ACTH 1/2 life = 10 Min.

Secretion is 40 uG/24 hours or 28 nG/Min.

Clearance = K * [ACTH]

28 = K * 0.05
K = 560

[Cortisol] may go up 4x as [ACTH] goes up 4x.

With maximum stimulation [ACTH] can go up to 150
pG/mL from a base of 30.

milli = 10^-3
micro = 10^-6
nano  = 10^-9
pico  = 10^-12
