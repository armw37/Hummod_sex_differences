MW = 40.08

[Conc(mG/dL)] = 9.4
[Conc(mMol/L)] = 2.35

mG/dL * 0.25 = mMol/L

[Conc(mG/mL)] = 0.0094

Volume distribution = 15000 (ECFV) for Ionized and Not Dissociated
Volume distribution = 3000 (PV) for Protein Bound

Ionized = 0.50 Total
Not Dissociated = 0.09 Total
Protein Bound = 0.41 Total

[Total] = Mass / (0.59 * ECFV + 0.41 * PV)

Mass = 0.0094 * (0.59 * 15000 + 0.41 * 3000) or 95 mG

[Total(mG/dL)] = 9.4
  Ionized = 4.7 (50%)
  Protein Bound = 3.8 (41%)
  Not Dissociated = 0.9 (9%)

A good source of information is

Kohlmeier, M. Nutrient Matabolism. Academic Press. 2003.

Kohlmeier has [Ca++] at 2.20 to 2.65 mMol/L. The average
is 2.42. Ca++ is divalent, so mEq/L is 4.85.
