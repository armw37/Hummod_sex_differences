Call TissueH2O.Init. At this call, the size of the body's 12 major
organs is known, including the H2O volume. So we get an initial
volume for all body water except blood volume, called tissue water.

Then the upper, middle and lower torsos are called to divide this
volume up among the three regions. These three regions run water
volume integrals.

Next is a call to ExternalH2O.Init. This sizes external water spaces
which is basically the water in the gut.

Next comes a call to BodyH2O.Init. This gets the initial value of
body water as the sum of

# Tissue H2O
# External H2O
# Plasma Volume
# RBC H2O

Then a call to ECFV.Init. This puts a fraction of body water into
the ECFV. A call to ICFV put the remainder into ICFV.

A call to InterstitialWater.Init get the initial total interstitial
water, which is ECFV - plasma volume and external (gut) water. We
use this to calculate a fraction for each organ that divides IFV
among the 12 organs.

At this point, we know the total water (intracellular and extracellular)
in each of the three regions and the total interstitial water in the
body.

A call to CellH2O.Init gets initial intracellular water for tissue,
which is total intracellular water minus RBC water. We use this to
to calculate a fraction for each organ that divides cell water among
the 12 organs.

A call to InterstitialProtein.Init gets a value for initial interstitial
protein which we then divide among the three torso regions.
