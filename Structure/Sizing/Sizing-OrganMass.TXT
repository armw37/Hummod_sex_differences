There are 12 major organs to be sized. Context gives us

Context-Adiposity.Mass(kG)
Context-Muscularity.Mass(kG)
Context-OtherMass.Mass(kG)

Other mass must be apportioned among the 10 organs besides
fat and muscle (the base organs). We do this on a % basis.

Then each of the 12 organ masses is divided into its H2O
and solid parts (composition) using individual fractions.
