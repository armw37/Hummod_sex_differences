We need the volume of distribution for EPO. Since it is a 30.4
kD protein, the volume of distribution is expected to be ECFV
or less.

Halstenson used 21 healthy young males and IV administration.
Volume of distribution is mL/kG. The clearance 1/2 time is
hours.

                VD   1/2 Time  % ECFV
-------------  ----  --------  ------
Epoetin Alpha  63.8    6.77     31.9
Epoetin Beta   70.0    8.79     35.0
-------------  ----  --------  ------
Average        66.9    7.78     33.4

I used an ECFV of 200 mL/kG. Therefore, the volume of
distribution as % of ECFV is 33.

Eckardt et.al. observed 1/2 times of 4.7 hours and 5.6 hours in
2 subjects changing from a hypobaric to normal environment.
