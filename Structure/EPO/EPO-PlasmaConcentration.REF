The normal range here is 10 to 20 mU/mL. I'm going to use

15 mU/ml
115 pG/mL

Eckardt et.al. reported 16 mU/mL and 17 mU/mL (read from graph).

But concentration may increase 100-fold to 1000-fold in severe
anemia (Cotes, paper is in files).

Coles et.al. used ELISA to measure [EPO] and got normal plasma
values of 11.1 pG/mL (1.4 mU/mL) which is an order of magnitude
less than typical RIA values. For now, I'm going with the RIA
values -- there is a lot of consistent data out there.
