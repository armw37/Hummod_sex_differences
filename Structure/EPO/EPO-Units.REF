MW ==========================================================

M.W. : 30.4 kD. 165 AA (Merck Index)

IU Units ====================================================

Cloned EPO may have the same MW as human EPO but different
potency, so units of potency have been defined.

130,000 Units (U) = 1 mG human EPO.

Concentration units are mU/mL (typical value ~ 13) and pG/mL.

Milli : 10^-3
Micro : 10^-6
Nano  : 10^-9
Pico  : 10^-12

We convert U to mU and mG to pG to get

0.130 mU = 1 pG

mU * 7.69 = pG
pG * 0.130 = mU

Therefore, a typical plasma EPO concentration of 13 mU/mL is
equal to 100 pG/mL.

Mole references are not of much use with proteins.
