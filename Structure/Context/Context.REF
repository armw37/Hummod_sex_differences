Context sets the model's traits, which then
scale the model.

The context code is executed when the model
is loaded (on restart) and any other time that
a restart is requested. The call goes to
Context.Calc.

Traits are parameters. When any have a value
change, they call Context.Calc and a complete
scaling is again undertaken.

End
