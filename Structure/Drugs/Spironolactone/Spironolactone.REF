Spironolactone tabs are 25, 50 and 100 mG.

Dosing is 25 to 500 mG/Day in a single or multiple doses.

Spironolactone has a half-life of 1.5 hours (90 minutes)
but its canrenone metabolite has a half-life of 16.5 hours
and is a strong aldosterone receptor antagonist.

Aldosterone : MW 360.4 C21-H28-O5 EC50 0.5 nMol/L

Spironolactone : MW 416.6 C24-H32-O4-S IC50 50 nMol/L

Canrenone : MW 340.5 C22-H28-O3 IC50 300 nMol/L

Dosing uses mG, but I think we should go to uG right in the
gut. Plasma concentrations are reported in nG/mL, but 90%+
of spironolactone and canrenone are bound to protein, mostly
plasma albumin.

 uG/mL * 10^6/MW = nMol/L

and uG/Min for flux.
