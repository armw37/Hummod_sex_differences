Glutamine is an aminated glutamate. Glutamate plus ammonia
yields glutamine plus water.

Two amino groups makes glutamine a useful source of ammonia
in the renal cortex.

After two de-aminations, the skeleton drops right into the
Krebs cycle as oxoglutarate or alpla-ketoglutarate. It then
spins to succinyl-CoA, oxaloacetate, pyruvate and glucose.

But if Krebs substrate is not needed the glutamine
can supply a single ammonium.

Glutamine + H2O --> NH4+ + Glutimate

Aspartate + Glutamate --> Asparagine + Glutamate
