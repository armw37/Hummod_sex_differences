Glutamate can be aminated to glutamine.

NH4+ + Alpha-Ketoglutarate <--> Glutamate

So alpha-ketoglutarate is just a glutamate with its
amino group and a proton removed and replaced by a
double bonded oxygen.

The 5 position can simply be shown as

like the one position.

And if Krebs substrate is not needed the glutamine
can supply a single ammonium.

Glutamine + H2O --> NH4+ + Glutimate

Glutamate + Oxaloacetate <--> Aspartate + Alpha-Ketoglutarate

Glutamate + Pyruvate <--> Alanine + Alpha-Ketoglutarate

Glutamate --> Proline

Aspartate + Glutamate --> Asparagine + Glutamate
