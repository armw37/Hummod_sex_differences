Non-essential. Food protein is about 5% alanine.

Muscle makes alanine as follows.

Glutamate + 2 Pyruvate <--> 2 Alanine + Alpha-Ketoglutarate

The glutamate supplies the needed amines. Then in
liver gluconeogenesis

2 Alanine --> 2 Pyruvate --> Glucose

with Alpha-Ketoglutarate going to Glutamate to carry
the 2 Amines but then giving them up form Urea.
