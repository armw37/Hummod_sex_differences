Stimulation of the cardiac nerves causes increases
in heart rate within a few seconds.

Edwards (below) measured ventilation and heart rate
at the start of 150W exercise. Both ventilation and
heart rate increased quickly hitting 60% of final
values at 1 minute and 85% at two minutes.

Final values were 57 L/Min (BTPS) and 170 Beats/Min.
Note that maximum heart rate is around 200 Beats/Min,
so there is not much upside left.

This indicates that the Beta control of heart rate is
almost totally neural, and the SA-node innervation
should be configured appropriately.

Edwards etal. JAP 32:165-169, 1972.

Wilson (below) compared the heart rate response in
cardiac denervated (heart transplant) patients to
controls. In the denervated patients, heart rate
rose slowly as if it was tracking catachol buildup
in the catechol pool. Maximum heart response was
much less than in control subjexts.

Heart Rate  Resting  Exercise    %
----------  -------  --------  ----
Control       76        178     100
Denervated    85        131      45
