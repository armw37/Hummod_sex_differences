Molecular weight of aldo is 360.4.
Thus 1 pMol = 360.4 pG.

Concentrations are pMol/L and
nG/100 mL

Typical [Aldo] is 330 pMol/L.

Volume of distribution is body
water (43,000 mL).

Aldo is cleared by the liver.
Extraction coefficient ~ 0.78,
working on splanchnic blood flow.

nG/dL = 0.036 * pMol/L.

Adrenal function depends on other
tissue function.

Acta Endo. 72:293, 1973.

This paper shows a rather quick rise
in [aldo] with AII infusion.  Thus,
I'll make the acute response immediate.
There may be a need later for a
chronic response.

The effect of [Aldo] on the nephron is
delayed. This should be implemented in
Nephron.
