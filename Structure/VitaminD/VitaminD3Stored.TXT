Hydroxylation is 11.7 nG/Min or 29.2 nMol/Min.

100 days worth of storage is 1685 uG.

Synthesis and storage over 24 hours is probably
2-5 times hydroxylation.

Sunlight

0 - None
1 - Dim
2 - Normal
3 - Bright
4 - Very Bright
5 - Extreme

Synthesis and diet supplement raises the
pool concentration and D3 diffuses into
storage.

I picked sequestration and mobilizaton of
50 nG/Min to calculate the K's.

With exp(-K*t) when t = 1/K, we have exp(-1)
which is 0.37. The exponential is 63% of the
way to completion, with 37% remaining. This
is the time constant (tau).

The half-time is the time when an exponential
is 50% of the way to completion.

T 1/2 = 0.69 * Tau

milli = 10^-3
micro = 10^-6
nano  = 10^-9
pico  = 10^-12
