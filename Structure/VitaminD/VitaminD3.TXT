C27-H44-O
MW : 384.6

1 IU = 0.025 uG
40 IU = 1 uG

Supplements run 200-500 IU/Day

I couldn't find any concentration data, so I
used 25-H values. Molecules are nearly identical
and they share a transporter.

[Conc] = 10 nG/mL or 26 nMol/L

NG/ML_TO_NMOL/L = 2.6

Volume distribution : 15000 (ECFV)

D3 appears not to degrade and the body can store
enough to get through a dark winter. This leaves
hydroxylation.

Hydroxylation is 11.7 nG/Min or 29.2 nMol/Min.

Mass is 150,000 nG, so lets use uG to get
better numbers.

With exp(-K*t) when t = 1/K, we have exp(-1)
which is 0.37. The exponential is 63% of the
way to completion, with 37% remaining. This
is the time constant (tau).

The half-time is the time when an exponential
is 50% of the way to completion.

T 1/2 = 0.69 * Tau

milli = 10^-3
micro = 10^-6
nano  = 10^-9
pico  = 10^-12
