The concept of grade in both roads and treadmills
is the change in elevation divide by the horizontal
distance travelled times 100.

The degree of the slope can be calculated from the
grade using arctan function.

For example, a 5% grade is a change in elevation of
5 for every 100 horizontal units. The angle is 2.9
degrees.
