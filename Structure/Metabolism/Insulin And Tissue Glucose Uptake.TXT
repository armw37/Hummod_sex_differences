Rizza RA, LJ Mandarino and JE Gerich. Dose-response
charactistics for effects of insulin on production
and utilization of glucose in man. Amer. J. Physiol.
240:E630-E639, 1981.

Data in this paper was redrawn in Pickup & Williams
(p.31.2) possibly with some artistic license.

[I] is uU/mL
Uptake is uptake in mG/Min
Prod is production in mG/Min

      [I] Uptake Prod
      500   700     0
       55   350     0
       30          70
Model  20    70    60
       10   120   140

This doesn't tell us about uptake with [I] ~ 0,
but it suggests that uptake may be 1/2 normal.

Guyton and Hall tell us that in the absence of
insulin, tissue glucose uptake is inadequate.

Whichelow, MJ and WJH Butterfield. Peripheral
glucose uptake during the oral glucose-tolerance
test in normal and obese subjects and borderline
and frank diabetics. Quart. J. Med. 40:261-273,
1971.

Forearm glucose uptake goes mostly to skeletal
muscle.

No [I] data, but the fasting [G] values are
impressive.

            [G]  Flow  Uptake
Normal       78   5.6   0.46
Borderline   86   5.9   0.55
Diabetics   198   5.3   0.25

So [G] is doubled and uptake is halved. [I] may
be 0 to 4, so lack of [I] cut uptake to 1/4!
