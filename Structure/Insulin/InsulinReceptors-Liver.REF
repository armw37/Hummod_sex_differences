Hepatic insulin receptors can really scarf up
the insulin. So net binding is always flow
limited to some extent. This is very important
when hepatic plasma flow is low.

[Insulin] - Hepatic insulin concentration.
[Portal Vein] - Portal vein insulin concentration.
PlasmaFlow - Portal vein plasma flow.
Binding - Rate of hepatic insulin binding.
K1 - Insulin binding constant.
K2 - Insulin unbinding constant.
Free - Mass of free insulin receptors.
Bound - Mass of bound insulin receptors.

We apply mass balance and solve for [Insulin]

[PortalVein] * PlasmaFlow = Binding - Unbinding + [Insulin] * PlasmaFlow
Binding = [Insulin] * K * Free
Unbinding = K2 * Bound

N = [PortalVein] * PlasmaFlow + K2 * Bound
D = K1 * Free + PlasmaFlow

[Insulin] = N / D
