We must be careful here with units. The traditional
unit for insulin is International Unit (U) where
mass and concentration in the body are milli (mU)
and micro (uU).

Pool = 300 mU
Secretion = 17 mU/Min and 17000 uU/Min
[Insulin] = 20 uU/mL

The physical units for insulin receptors are mU.

There is a total mass of receptors (mU) with part
of the mass bound and the remainder free.

Binding = K1 * [Insulin] * Free
Unbinding = K2 * Bound
Degradation = K3 * Bound
