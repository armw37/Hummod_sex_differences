Cortisol (hydrocortisone) is secreted by the
adrenal cortex. It accounts for 95% of the
body's glucocorticoid activity.

Corticosterone accounts for 5% and will not
be initially modeled.

Cortisol MW = 362.5
C21-H30-O5

Concentration is highly variable with a
circadian rhythm and secretion bursts.

[Cortisol] = 20 uG/dL or 550 nMol/L.

uG/dL * 27.6 = nMol/L

Volume of distribution = 15000 (ECFV, assumed).

Mass = 3000 uG.

1/2 life = 75 Min. Cleared by liver.

Secretion is 15 mG/24 hours or 10.4 uG/Min.

Clearance = K * [Cortisol] or 10.4 = K * 0.2
K = 52

Cortisol can increase hepatic gluconeogenesis
from amino acids up to 10x. This will increase
[Glucose] 50%.

[Cortisol] may go up 4x as [ACTH] goes up 4x.

milli = 10^-3
micro = 10^-6
nano  = 10^-9
pico  = 10^-12
