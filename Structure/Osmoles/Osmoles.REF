Notice that both ECFV and ICFV are electrically neutral,
yet list cations are considerably more than list anions.
That is because proteins are a significant but weak anion
while playing little role in osmolarity.

Volume partition is determined by active osmolality, not
total (or potential) osmolality. This means that the ECFV
and ICFV partitions can have different osmolalities,
depending on their individual mix of anions and cations.

For sizing, total osmolarity ~302 mOsm/L and the dissociation
constant of 0.90. We start with an initial active osmolality
of 282 mOsm/L (Guyton and Hall).

Electrolytes are specified as mEq/L. Divalent ions contribute
one half. I'm going to put in some place holders that might
be used later to implement additional detail.

For ECFV osmolarity (volume = 15 L),

[Cations] = 146.4
[Na+] = 142
[K+] = 4.4
[OtherCations] = 0

[Anions] = 134.0
[Cl-] = 108
[HCO3-] = 24.0
[Lac-] = 1.0
[KA-] = 0.1
[SO4--] = 0.3
[PO4--] = 0.2
[OtherAnions] = 0

[Total Ions] = 280.4

[Glucose] = 5.6
[Urea] = 4.0
[OtherOsmoles] = 12.0

[TotalOsmoles] = 302

For ICFV (volume = 27 L),

[Cations] = 174
[K+] = 140
[Other Cations] = 34

[Anions] = 80
[OtherAnions] = 80

[TotalIons] = 254 

[Urea] = 4.0
[OtherOsmoles] = 44

[TotalOsmoles] = 302

Urea diffuses rapidly but can cause transient osmotic
effects, such a during dialysis.
