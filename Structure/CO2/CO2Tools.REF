The first study of solubility of CO2 in blood was

   Christiansen, Douglas and Haldane, J.Physiol.
   48:244, 1914.

This study also has very good data for blood CO2
content as a function of pCO2.

We need a relationship for [HCO3-], SID and pCO2.

Units ================================================================

Total blood CO2 content is reported as mL (of STP gas) / mL (of blood)
and also as mMol/L. In this analysis, we'll deviate slighly and use
mMol/mL in the mathematics.

A mMol of gas occupies a standard volume of 22.4 mL.  Multiply mL/mL
by 44.6 to get mMol/L. Multiply by 0.0446 to get mMol/mL.

Square brackets [ ] indicated concentration.

SID means <i>strong ion difference</i>.

Overview =============================================================

CO2 in the blood is mainly (88%) transported as bicarbonate [HCO3].
The remaining 12% is bound to proteins or in solution. As a first
approximation, we'll consider bicarbonate transport only.

The concentration of HCO3 in the blood is a function of the partial
pressure of CO2 (pCO2) as quantitated by CO2's disassociation curve.
But [HCO3] is also a function of [SID].

To get an acceptable physiological representation, we must model both
of these factors.

CO2 Dissociation Curve ================================================

This relationship was accurately described a century ago.

This relationship might adequately be modeled using pCO2/(p50 + pCO2).
Note that the function must be invertible and this one is.

Looking at the data, I estimate that the p50 for HCO3 as a function
of PCO2 is 32 mmHg.

Strong Ion Difference ==================================================

Just as important as pCO2 is [SID], which modulates the pCO2 to
[HCO3] equilibrium constant. A decreasing [SID] (acidosis) decreases
[HCO3] for a given pCO2. This data comes from another early study.

The following model may be adequate.

  [HCO3] = K * (pCO2/(p50 + pCO2))
  K = k * [SID]
  p50 = 32

where K is a linear function of [SID]. We can now fit k to a typical
data set.

Normal Values ==========================================================

Normal values for venous blood.

  pCO2 = 45 mmHg
  [HCO3] = 0.0255 mMol/mL
  [SID] = 0.040 mMol/mL

I popped these values into a spread sheet to get

  k = 1.09

Arterial Values =========================================================

Normal values for arterial blood.

  pCO2 = 40 mmHg
  [HCO3] = 0.0237 mMol/mL
  [SID] = 0.040 mMol/mL

For these values of pCO2 and [SID], the model predicts

  [HCO3] = 0.0242

Exercise Values =========================================================

[SID] and pCO2 are altered by exercise and both have
a significant effect on [HCO3]. Venous and arterial
values are altered in their own special ways.

Increased pCO2 tends to increase [HCO3] while decreased [SID] tends to
decrease it.

On the venous side, the pCO2 and [SID] effects are roughly
offsetting. On the arterial side, the [SID] effect lowers
[HCO3] while the arterial pCO2 is close to normal.

On the venous side, pCO2 increases significantly. On the arterial
side, ventilation takes care of the CO2 and the arterial values are
close to normal.

[SID] decreases during exercise mainly due to lactic acid accumulation,
which is proportional to the severity of the exercise.

Using this data, my best estimate for values at 200W is shown below.

  pCO2 = 70 mmHg
  [HCO3] = 0.0245 mMol/mL
  [SID] = 0.026 mMol/mL

For these values of pCO2 and [SID], the model predicts

  [HCO3] = 0.0195

Across The Lungs ======================================================

The units are

  [HCO3], SID - mEq/mL
  pCO2 - mmHg

We exhale 200 mL/Min of CO2 as 5400 mL of blood pass
through the lungs.  Each mL of blood loses 0.037 mL
of CO2.  1 mEq of HCO3 is equal to 22.4 mL of gas.
Thus, the change in CO2 across the lungs is 0.0016
mEq/mL.

pCO2 decreases about 5 mmHg across the lungs. When
we model the Haldane effect, pCO decreases about
2 1/2 mmHg due to HCO3 loss and 2 1/2 mmHg due to
the increase in O2 saturation.

Inverting =============================================================

  [HCO3] = K * (pCO2/(p50 + pCO2))
  K = k * [SID]
  p50 = 32

Forward expression inverts to

  pCO2 = (p50 * [HCO3]) / (K - [HCO3])
  K = k * [SID]
  p50 = 32

Valid for [HCO3] >= 0 and [HCO3] < k * [SID]

For [HCO3] < 0 use pCO2 = 0
For [HCO3] >= k * [SID] use pCO2 = PCO2_LARGE or 1000

Estimating Metabolic Rate =============================================

This is off topic. I assume that there is a negligible pCO2 gradient
between cell and effluent blood. The effluent pCO2 increases with
increasing metabolic rate and decreases with increasing blood flow.

We can create a heuristic scaler (k) and calculate metabolic rate (Cal)
as a function of pCO2 and blood flow (Flow).

  Cal = k * (pCO2 / Flow)

TISSUE ================================================================

Tissue is qualitatively the same as blood but
quantitatively different due to different SID's
and intrinsic [HCO3]. The two cases are tissue in
general and skeletal muscle.

Tissue In General =====================================================

  [HCO3-] = 0.016 mEq/mL
  pCO2 = 45 mmHg
